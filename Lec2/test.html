<h2 id="story1"> Story 1</a>


<p>Alex Thunder was thinking about Zoe Gobble again. Zoe was an adorable angel with beautiful thighs and pretty eyes.

Alex walked over to the window and reflected on his beautiful surroundings. He had always loved crowded Paris with its pretty, pickled parks. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel ecstatic.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the an adorable figure of Zoe Gobble.

Alex gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an admirable, kind, tea drinker with curvy thighs and pink eyes. His friends saw him as a great, green gamer. Once, he had even revived a dying, baby.

But not even an admirable person who had once revived a dying, baby, was prepared for what Zoe had in store today.

The rain hammered like loving kittens, making Alex sparkly. Alex grabbed a tiny banana that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Alex stepped outside and Zoe came closer, he could see the snotacular glint in her eye.

Zoe gazed with the affection of 5563 special depressed duck. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a resolution."

Alex looked back, even more sparkly and still fingering the tiny banana. "Zoe, let's get married," he replied.

They looked at each other with happy feelings, like two green, gifted goldfish chatting at a very lovable Valentine's meal, which had jazz music playing in the background and two gentle uncles eating to the beat.

Alex regarded Zoe's beautiful thighs and pretty eyes. "I feel the same way!" revealed Alex with a delighted grin.

Zoe looked sleepy, her emotions blushing like a tiny, tight teapot.

Then Zoe came inside for a nice cup of tea.
